# ITERATION 2
### Corrected errors from Iteration 1:
- Corrected Login and Register and User added correctly to database
- Corrected text field's order aftter hitting TAB 
- Current user label updated after logging in
- Requirements Analysis artifacts
  
### Implemented new things:
- The following things were mandatory:
  
Implemented User/Driver/Traveler hierarchy
 - Added 2 more use cases: Create Alert and Book Ride
 - The application is op ened as a not logged in user which can query rides but must log in in order to do anything else.
 - Changed the available buttons depending on user type
 - Created a window to display and delete alerts, and if a matching ride is found the option booking the ride
 - Created sequence Diagram for "Query Rides" use case

### Iteration 2 struggles
The sequence diagram was a reality check for the app implementation. 
Major changes had to be done on the application flow, such as intercommunication between differents UIs.
