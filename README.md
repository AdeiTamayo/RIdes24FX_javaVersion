# Abstract 
This Readme file is a resume of the SE1 ShareTrip project. 
It contains the following sections:



# ITERATION 1
### We implemented the following things:
- Implemented requrements analysis: Domain Model + Use Case Diagram + Event Flow
- Changed project layout to BorderPane layout
- Implemented the register and login use cases

---
# ITERATION 2
### Corrected errors from Iteration 1:
- Corrected Login and Register and User added correctly to database
- Corrected text field's order aftter hitting TAB 
- Current user label updated after logging in
- Requirements Analysis artifacts
  
### Implemented new things:
* The following things were mandatory:
  * Implemented User/Driver/Traveler hierarchy
    * Added 2 more use cases: Create Alert and Book Ride 
    * The application is opened as a not logged in user which can query rides but must log in in order to do anything else. 
    * Changed the available buttons depending on user type. 
    * Created sequence Diagram for "Query Rides" use case.
    * Added three new event flows: Create Alert, Query Alert and Remove Alert.
    
* The following things were optional:
  * Created 'Clear' button: clears the text fields.
  * Implemented 'Return' button: returns to the main GUI. 
  * Created a window to display and delete alerts, and if a matching ride is found the option booking the ride.
  * Ride date appears on the top corner when date is selected.
  * Created home GUI.


### Iteration 2 struggles
The sequence diagram was a reality check for the app implementation. 
* Major changes had to be done on the application flow, such as new intercommunications between differents UIs.

 ---
 # ITERATION 3
 ### Corrected errors from Iteration 2:
 - Minor fix on Query Rides sequence diagram
 - Fixed the create ride GUI to implement combo boxes for the city selection and Spinners.

### Implemented new things:
This iteration is a bit different from the previous ones. We made the following changes:
* The following changes were mandatory:
  * Implement (at least) a new feature
    * We chose the new feature to be: the accept reservation feature for the driver.
  * Prepare a presentation for the final version of the project
 
* Alongside the mandatory implementations we added the following which were optional:
  * New use case: Query reservations
    * Both traveler and driver users can access a list of their reservations, check the state of the reservations and       delete them.
  * New user case: Create a ride from the Alert ui.
    * The same ui as in the normal AlertsView is displayed but the driver has the option of creating a ride based on 
      an existing alert.
  * Improve query alerts feature: Add the option of displaying all different prices for an alert with a matching ride 
    and book the ride with the selected price.
  * Query data using API: Retrieve city info from the internet.
  * Added functionality to remove the success messages after certain time.

### Iteration 3 struggles
The main struggle was to implement the API to retrieve city information.
* The API was not working as expected, and we had to change the API to a different one.

We also had problems with the Location domain, we had to change the way we were storing the location information and retrieving it.
## How to test the application

There are two users already created for practical purposes:

- **Driver:**
  - **Email:** driver@
  - **Password:** 1

- **Traveler:**
  - **Email:** traveler@
  - **Password:** 1

### Notes on City Info API Testing

When testing the City Info API, please keep the following points in mind:

- The API primarily selects the biggest cities. Therefore, not all cities may appear in the results. For example, Tolosa might not be listed.
- The API is capable of detecting the name of the city in various languages. However, for some cities, this feature may not work as expected. For instance, Iru√±a might not be recognized correctly.
- There's a limit for the amount of queries possible, due to the API's own limit.
